Hello! My name is Qiyuan Feng (冯祺媛). I am an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester (expected graduation year 2024), where I studied Brain and Cognitive Science (B.S.) and Computer Science (B.A.). My current research is primarily on visual perception and attention.

For a more complete record of my academic journey, please see my [CV](/cv).

## About this Site

This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by 
  [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/).
  The original project, called [`jekyll academic`](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/)
  has its own [github repository](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic)
  and [workshop documentation](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/workshop/).
