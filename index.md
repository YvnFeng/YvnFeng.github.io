Hello! My name is Qiyuan Feng (冯祺媛). I am an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester (expected graduation: Spring 2024), studying Brain and Cognitive Science (B.S.) and Computer Science (B.A.), with a minor in Social Psychology and a minor in Digital Media Studies. My current research interest is primarily on visual perception and attention. I am currently an undergrad research assistant in [MarmoLab](https://marmolab.bcs.rochester.edu/), and also a summer student in [Brainard Lab @UPenn](https://color.psych.upenn.edu/).

For a more complete record of my academic journey, please see my [CV](https://github.com/YvonnaFeng/YvonnaFeng.github.io/blob/master/Qiyuan%20Feng%20-%20CV_202303.pdf).
