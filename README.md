## Introduction
This template utilizes Jekyll, an open source static website generator, as well as a theme based largely off of the Minimal Mistakes theme by Michael Rose. The purpose of this template is to provide you with a simple, well designed website that is optimized for hosting on Github pages. We aim to reduce the technological know-how and time that is usually required for maintaining a personal or professional website.
